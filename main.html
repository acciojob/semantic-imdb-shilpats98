        <summary>Minnal Murali (transl.â€‰Lightning Murali) is a 2021 Indian Malayalam-language superhero film directed by
            Basil Joseph and produced by Sophia Paul, under the banner of Weekend Blockbusters. The screenplay has been
            written by Arun Anirudhan and Justin Mathew. The film stars Tovino Thomas and Guru Somasundaram. The story
            follows the life of Jaison, a young tailor who gains superpowers after being struck by lightning, and
            transforms into a superhero.

            The film was formally announced in January 2019, but due to the extensive pre-production works, the film's
            principal photography took place during December 2019. Though shooting got disrupted twice following the two
            waves of the COVID-19 pandemic and the vandalism of a church set by right-wing groups, the makers managed to
            complete the shoot within July 2021. The film was predominantly shot in Kerala, with few sequences being
            shot at Hassan in Karnataka. The music of the film was composed by Shaan Rahman and Sushin Shyam, with Shyam
            also composing the background score, whereas cinematography of the film was handled by Sameer Thahir and
            editing done by Livingston Mathew.

            The film was set for a theatrical release in late-2020, but was postponed multiple times due to the COVID-19
            pandemic. In September 2021, the makers announced that the film will be released directly through the
            streaming platform Netflix, as a result of closure of theatres due to the pandemic. It was premiered at the
            Mumbai Film Festival on 16 December, and was premiered worldwide on the occasion of Christmas Eve (24
            December 2021).[2][3] It received critical acclaim praising the cast performances (particularly Tovino
            Thomas and Guru Somasundaram), writing, direction, action sequences, VFX and soundtrack.
            In 1990s, Jaison, A young tailor from the village of Kurukkanmoola, is in dreams of building a career in the
            US. SI Saajan forbids Jaison's relationship with his daughter Bincy, as she is already engaged to Aneesh.
            Aneesh's ex-girlfriend Bruce Lee Biji is also enraged that Aneesh had broken up with her. Meanwhile, Shibu
            is a social outcast, who works in a teashop and he was waiting 28 years for the returning of his childhood
            sweetheart Usha, who is also the sister of Daasan. Daasan works in Jaison's and his father Varkey's tailor
            shop. Usha has a daughter, who needs an urgent medical operation, but she does not have that much cash for
            the operation. On Christmas Eve, a lightning bolt simultaneously strikes Jaison, who is arguing with Saajan,
            and Shibu, who is stalking Usha. Jaison is rushed to the hospital, but to everyone's surprise, he is
            seemingly unharmed. In the following days, Jaison and Shibu show signs of superpowers. Jaison's nephew,
            Josemon, comes to the conclusion that Jaison gained superpowers after being hit by the lightning.Usha comes
            to Shibu's teashop where the owner flirt with Usha. Shibu is enraged and threatens him with his new
            telekinetic powers, asking him to stay away from her. Meanwhile, Jaison's plans to leave to the US come to
            an unexpected halt after his passport verification doesn't go through after Saajan meddles with it and also
            reveals that Varkey is not Jaison's father and his real father is Martin, a theatre actor who died while
            Jaison was young when the set of the village play caught fire. Varkey saw the young Jaison and felt pity for
            him, raising Jaison as his own son. Jaison is heartbroken after hearing the news. Varkey tells Jaison that
            he didn't reveal the truth earlier as he feared that Jaison would abandon him and his father helped everyone
            in the village and died for the sake of village. Jaison realizes that Saajan had hit Varkey and is enraged.
            With the help of Josemon, Jaison disguises himself with a mask and goes to Josemon's school's anniversary
            where many policemen, including Saajan and Pothan, are present as the security for the chief guest.

            Jaison, wearing the costume, attacks Saajan and the policeman including Biji, who tried to stop him. He
            writes the name Minnal Murali on the front curtain of the stage the anniversary event was held, which was
            named after a character in Martin's unfinished play. Usha's daughter faints and is taken to the hospital.
            The doctor tells Usha that her daughter needs to start the operation on her now or else she might die. Shibu
            learns of this and disguise himself as Minnal Murali and robs the local bank at the same time when Jaison
            attacked Saajan. When Shibu provides the money to the hospital, He learns that Daasan had already paid for
            it. Meanwhile, Siby Pothan, Jaison's brother-in-law finds out that Jaison is Minnal Murali, but Saajan does
            not believe him. Jaison had been saving money that was given by his sister for applying for visa, keeping it
            in his tailor shop, but it was stolen by Daasan. Jaison gives a deadline to Daasan that he should bring him
            the money back before evening.

            Meanwhile, Usha slowly warms up to Shibu, but Daasan rejects him. Jaison realizes his mistake and goes to
            Daasan to apologize. Shibu comes to Jaison's store and accused Daasan of being the obstacle between his and
            Usha's relationship and burns down the store, killing Daasan, and then blames Minnal Murali for the crime.
            Jaison reveals to Biji that he is Minnal Murali. Biji and Josemon decide to help Jaison prove to the
            villagers that he is not the one who robbed the bank and killed Daasan while also finding the imposter. The
            police and Jaison view footage of the store on the night when Daasan died, at the police station to check
            the identity of 'Minnal Murali,' but the power goes out the exact moment they are about to find Shibu.
            Shibu, wearing a mask, ambushes the police station in an attempt to destroy the video, the only evidence to
            show that he is the impostor, but Jaison as Minnal Murali attacks him and steals the video cassette.

            Jaison and Shibu fight at the moving bus, where Shibu bests Jaison due to him having telekinesis, which
            Jaison does not have. Shibu destroys the cassette and escapes. However, in the altercation, the bus driver
            hits his head and dies, which leads to the bus not stopping before reaching the edge of a cliff, dangling
            precariously off of it, but Jaison saves the bus, which gains him a few villagers's respect. Jaison and
            Shibu start investigating and they learn about each other's identity. Saajan and the force arrive to arrest
            Shibu as they learn that Shibu is the impersonator, but Shibu scares them away. Pothan finds a picture of
            Minnal Murali and shows it to Saajan. Saajan believes Pothan's findings and Pothan arrests Jaison. Usha
            comes to Shibu's house and realizes Shibu's love for her and reciprocates it. Shibu sees a mob outside his
            home and tries to stop them, but unknown to Shibu, his house slowly catches on fire. A barrel full of
            firecrackers catch fire, causing his house to explode, killing Usha and her daughter and injuring Shibu.
